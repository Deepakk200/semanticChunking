Not ten years ago, the majority \nof traditional doctors wouldn’t dream of prescribing cannabis to their \npatients, insisting that it was dangerous and unstudied. Yet once their patients \nbegan sharing the positive outcomes they were discovering, and the relief they \nwere experiencing, doctors slowly began the shift toward a “don’t ask, don’t tell” \npolicy. This small level of acceptance was an important first step, but in reality, it \nwasn’t all that helpful to their patients. We turn to doctors when we need specific \nhealth advice, and this attitude was anything but specific. Today, a second shift toward greater understanding and acceptance is taking \nplace. Many of the most conservative medical practitioners from the finest hospi -\ntals are recommending that their patients consider medical cannabis, at times even \nbefore other traditional medicines. Over the past ten years, the scientific press has \nbeen publishing more cannabis research than at any other time in history. At the \nsame time, the public outcry for legalization of cannabis paved the way for normal-\nizing cannabis therapies. Growing communities of cannabis enthusiasts have also \ncoalesced to spread information and education about the effectiveness of cannabis \ntreatments. A true scientific understanding now shows that there is a diverse set of \nmedical concerns and symptoms that cannabis can address. With this level of normalization, you may be able to finally address your men-\ntal or physical concerns with a legitimate and effective strategy.",

I took that message to heart, because \nnobody I personally knew who was reputable or intelligent consumed cannabis (at \nleast openly). I followed my father into the family business, which was medicine. When I \ngot to medical school in 2006, I was never taught anything of substance about can-\nnabis, despite the growing cultural acceptance of its therapeutic effects. Instead, \nmy earlier impressions of cannabis were solidified because in medical school it \nwas taught only through the lens of addiction, dependence, and maladaptation. Sadly, that lack of clinical education that could support new physicians in training \nremains, even today. I focused my medical education on the goal of having a family medicine prac-\ntice. I would treat all kinds of people who suffer from a wide range of illnesses, \nand I liked the challenge of trying to develop expertise in many different subjects: \nI could be a psychiatrist with one patient, a rheumatologist with another, and a \ndermatologist later in the day. This model also suited my idea of what an ideal \nphysician should be. I decided early on that I would stay at the forefront of medi-\ncine, listen carefully to my patients, and encourage them to be open with me. My \nprimary goal was never to pass pills, but to help my patients consider their own \nbest options. Over the years, there were times inside my clinic when my patients felt com -\nfortable enough to be completely open, whether it was about their drug use, their \nsexuality, or their relationships. It was through these candid conversations that my \npatients first introduced the medical benefits of cannabis to me. This oral tradition \nis a theme for cannabis in our culture: even in the face of political, social, cultural, \nor spiritual adversity, cannabis use survives because its effects are told from one \nperson to another. As I was charting these particular patients’ health progress, \nI was astounded by how well they were doing: their health was improving, they \nappeared happier and less physically and emotionally burdened by their illnesses, \nand often, they were able to give up other prescription medications, over time.",

I have found that one step better than randomized, evidence-based science \nis mathematical fact, and that comes from discerning polling. If we poll enough \npeople on their experience with guided cannabis medicine, including details about \nthemselves, the products they choose, and the circumstances when they take them, \nwe can approach a mathematical certainty in terms of best practices. In effect, I’m \ndoing my own crowdsourcing. Along with my own patients, I have formed a com-\npany that is creating the largest clinical data set about cannabis consumption.

It adjusts its growth patterns to optimize exposure to light, \nrain, and soil quality, as well as the time of year it blooms, and to what array of \naromatic compounds it produces when it blooms. Like fine wines, the assortment \nof environmental conditions influences a specific terroir, resulting in a wide range \nof plant characteristics. This is why some cannabis products smell like fresh mint \nand pine, and others like lavender or skunk. Over the centuries, farmers learned that the cannabis plant was useful in \nmany ways and could be cultivated to get the most useful properties out of it: \nfrom increasing the euphoric experience to strengthening the plant’s fibers so that \nit could be used for rope, paper, or thread. As each different use was identified, \nand farming techniques improved to optimize certain characteristics, the plant \nevolved into several distinct gene pools. While similar in appearance, the varieties \nof  gen\nders/relatives are, at the same time, starkly different in their growth product. Some gene pools of the female cannabis plants produced bigger flowers that create \nlots of potentially smokable stuff and contain large amounts of the compound \nTHC. Taller, stronger, and more fibrous plants that were easier to harvest were sin-\ngled out for industrial use: these plants became known as hemp. It just so happens \nthat the hemp plants that produce a lot of fiber and small flowers contain fewer \ncompounds that produce a euphoric, intoxicating effect, and the genetic relatives \nof those plants happen to produce CBD. This natural duality of cannabis presents \ntwo families of choice that you will be learning about in this book. In fact, these \nfamilies existed as far back as six hundred years ago, when manual laborers were \nmaking paper, roof thatching, and rope out of hemp by day, and then smoking its \ncousin for its medicinal effects. Yet the cannabis plant offers much more than strength and psychedelics. Because of its environmental adaptability, the cannabis plant developed a full \nrange of chemical diversity. Many of its chemical components and/or compounds \nwere used as powerful medicines for thousands of years, with a wide range of \napplications. As time went on and farming techniques improved, the characteris-\ntics that were highly prized were cultivated, and the ones that seemed less relevant",

Terpenes are aromatic compounds found in all plants, and cannabis contains \nexceptionally high concentrations of them. Interestingly, foods that are high in ter-\npenes are also thought to be healthy for you. For example, the foods featured in a \nMediterranean-style diet—olive oil, lemons, red wine—are high in terpenes and \nthought to be cardioprotective, prevent diabetes, and help keep a consistent weight.3 \nMost of the smells we are familiar with from the natural world—from lemon \nto cinnamon to pine—are terpenes. Their rich aromas span the gamut: sweet, \ntangy, citrus sour, woody pungent, and hundreds more. All of these scents can \nbe found in cannabis plants, and where they are grown or what they are grown \nwith will determine which terpenes they contain. What’s more, each terpene has a \npowerful function beyond its scent, driving wellness and enriching the activity of \ncannabinoid molecules. Some of the common smells of cannabis—fruity, woody, \nskunky—are terpenes that naturally attract and repel certain wildlife. The unusual high presence of diverse terpenes is one of the major reasons that \ncannabis has maintained its popularity (in nature and in human consumption) \nfor millennia. In different regions with different climates, the cannabis plant has \nadapted to thrive by producing an array of terpenes that optimizes the plant’s ability \nto flourish. For example, in sunny climates, the plant has more terpenes that protect \nit from harmful UV light exposure; it has also evolutionarily adjusted its composi-\ntion of terpenes to attract local pollinating insects and repel predators. This innate \nsurvival mechanism has meant that it is essentially impossible to find two plants \nthat produce identical chemical profiles. Even within a single plant, the terpene \ncompounds produced at the top of the plant will differ from those at the bottom. Terpenes have beneficial effects when isolated as well as when they are \nused in conjunction with cannabinoids. For instance, one terpene called beta-  \nca\nryophyllene is a molecule that not only has a musky, spicy odor (like cracked \npepper), but it also has calming properties. When used at the same time as canna -\nbinoids, either in edible form or in a lotion, the mixture of the two amplifies each \ncompound’s effect.",

While the dietary benefits of certain fla-\nvonoids have been known to human cultures for thousands of years (this is why \ngrandparents have been forever telling us to eat fruits, vegetables, teas, red wine, \nand dark chocolate), the scientific underpinning of their medicinal value is a rela-\ntively recent phenomenon. Their value is attributed to both their antioxidative and \nanti-inflammatory properties, which help stabilize biology that may be prone to \nmutations such as cancers. One famous flavonoid is resveratrol, which is found in \nred wine and dark chocolates and is thought to be life-extending. The Big Flavonoid List\nThe following list features the most recognized flavonoids and in which circum -\nstances they could be used. Like the secondary cannabinoids, the market has yet \nto find an effective way to isolate these ingredients. It is possible to source cannabis \nthat is higher in one type of flavonoid than another, but they usually come as part \nof a THC or CBD product. To release them, you need to bring the product to a \nspecific boiling point (you’ll learn how to do this in chapter four).

What’s more, as local plant growth \nhas become more feasible and socially accepted, fresh terpenes and regionally \nunique flavonoid content have similarly developed and improved. Whereas can-\nnabis may have once been full of prominence and noteworthy sensory effects \n(stinky), it has since become an overflowing factory of nutritional terpene and \nflavonoid abundance. Today, cannabis is brought to market in a fresher, more robust state because \nit can be legally grown in many states across the US. As a consequence, it has \na different chemical profile, and depending upon the method of delivery (fresh \nflower, solutions of cannabinoids dissolved in oils, cooked edibles, etc.), its inher-\nent chemical profiles are now amenable to new combinations with other popular \nagents (melatonin, caffeine, wine, antioxidants, etc.). What’s more, legally pur-\nchased modern cannabis is subject to rigorous testing and safety standards in order \nto reach a completely new level of purity. As you’ve learned, the natural chemical variability within each cannabis plant \nwas once multifactorial and diverse. However, the growing demand from consum-\ners of particular attributes means that producers only focus on the specific factors \nthat satisfy the marketplace.

The vestiges of that worldview still exist in our life: we drink coffee when \nwe’re sluggish, or pop a mint when we have digestive distress. We also \nknow that people on every continent have used the cannabis plant throughout \nhuman history as a regular part of life, and often to provide relief. There are arche-\nological and historical records of cannabis use for medicinal purposes across thou -\nsands of years, covering areas from China to India to Africa to South America, and \neventually to the US. The earliest settlers in the Jamestown colonies grew cannabis and used it both \nmedicinally and for currency. By 1839, physicians like William O’Shaughnessy \nwere providing cannabis extracts to patients for its analgesic and sedative proper-\nties.1 The peak of cannabis use as medicine in the US was during the early twenti -\neth century, when it could be easily obtained as an over-the-counter remedy, and \nthere were more than a hundred scientific papers published on its therapeutic use.2\nBy the 1930s, cannabis use was on the rise for both recreational use and medi-\ncation.

The reason: it has the ability to com-\nmunicate with just about every cell in the body via the endocannabinoid system . Endo refers to molecules that are produced inside your body. Cannabinoid  refers \nto the collection of molecules and their precursors—either naturally occurring \nwithin the body, or produced from plants—and their receptors in the body. This \nreceptor/molecule combination activates a massive array of positive health effects. Cannabis products are literal copycats of endocannabinoids: they are almost iden -\ntical to the form and function of the naturally occurring molecules that are found \nin almost all living creatures. The endocannabinoid molecules we naturally produce are called anandamide \n(AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglyerol (2-AG). AEA is found in nearly all animal tissues \nand some plant tissues. 2-AG is found at high levels in the nervous system, and \nis derived from the same essential pathways as AEA. There are also cannabinoid \nmolecules that are produced outside of the body, specifically from plants, which \nare called phytocannabinoids. All plant-derived cannabis products, whether they \nare THC-based or CBD-based, are considered phytocannabinoids.",

When we use cannabis products, the same \npeacefulness can be re-created from an external tool set that is the same shape and \nfunctions as the stuff our body produces naturally, hitting the same receptors. All types of cannabinoids act as messengers: they send signals to receptors. Almost every cell in the human body has receptors for these molecules, and there \nare between eighteen and thirty different types of receptors. Whether you are \nchewing on a cannabis gummy, using a tincture, or applying a lotion, cannabinoids \nfind their way to individual cell receptors. On their way to the receptors, some can-\nnabis molecules go through a conformational change , where they are metabolized \ninto different molecules with different interactive properties. Once changed, they \ncan become stronger, while others may become weaker.

Depending on the raw product first consumed, and the strength of your \nmetabolism on a given day, you may have different experiences with the same \ncannabis. For example, when cannabis is inhaled, the blood vessels may recognize \nand take in cannabis’s raw, unchanged form, which is different from when you \nconsume it orally and it’s gone through conformational changes via the gastroin-\ntestinal system.

The cannabinoid’s chemical messengers then enter the cells via receptors called \nG protein–linked receptors. These are proteins that cross the cell wall and then create a \ntranscellular communication system to allow for signals to be transmitted from out-\nside to the insides of the cell. Once at the receptors, cannabinoids create effects that \nare either local (in one area of the body), or systemic (throughout the body). All of \nour endocannabinoid receptors are waiting to interact with cannabinoid molecules: \nthese molecules are fundamental to influence almost all biological drives, including \nappetite, memory, temperature regulation, pleasure, pain, and satisfaction. For example, if cannabis lotion is applied to an arm or a leg, you will have \na local response. The reason is that there’s a high concentration of cannabinoid \nand terpenoid molecules, which has a direct effect on local nerves, regional blood \nvessels, and nearby muscle tissues. You will feel less pain because inflammation is \nreduced, your muscles will relax where the lotion was applied, or local tumors may \nshrink and eventually disappear. The lotion molecules will eventually dissipate \ninto the rest of the body, but will not have a strong systemic effect because there \naren’t enough molecules left to travel through the bloodstream. If you are using oral cannabis products, you are typically taking a higher dose \nthan what’s available in a topical, and there will be enough molecules to spread \nthroughout the whole body. In this case, you are creating a series of local effects \neverywhere that these molecules travel, acting as multi-location muscle relaxers \nand system-wide nerve soothers. Systemic products also have indirect effects: you \nwill also experience overall pain relief in each place the cannabinoids are causing \nlocal smooth muscle relaxation—it’s as if all your cells were saying collectively, \n“Phew, we are feeling good.”\nOnce the molecules match with a receptor, cannabinoids can influence the \nbody in a few distinct ways.

For inactive stem cells, on the \nother hand, a cannabinoid jolt at the cell surface might mean rejuvenating the \ncell’s machinery into renewed production mode. Cannabinoids also have an epigenetic  effect on cells, or how (and which of) \nour genes within each cell are turned on or off, which can influence our health. Cannabinoids have the power to increase and decrease the transcription of DNA \nand the translation of RNA into proteins. They can clean up certain parts of cells \nto free up dormant actions. For example, in cancer, a cell’s ability to self-destruct, \ncalled apoptosis, is hijacked. One of the ways that cannabis seems to work in killing \ncancer cells while sparing normal cells is by reinvigorating apoptosis, so that the \ncancer cells self-destruct and healthy cells are left unaltered. Cannabinoids can also have a direct effect on nerve signaling, which governs \nthoughts, movement, and sensory function. You can think about your brain as \nthe top of a pyramid, sending signals down that affect other systems throughout \nthe body via the nervous system.

I often describe cannabis as a “tangible essence of \nmeditation,” a tool that leverages an organic state of mindfulness. People under-\nstand meditation as a dialing back of normal stimulation, normal thought pro -\ncesses, a slowing, a muting of normal input. Just like when we go to sleep and \nour body and mind slows down, cannabis causes a slowing down of all the body’s \nmotors, physically, intellectually, in a way that’s similar to meditation.

The reason why cannabis is so effective is that it has adaptogenic  properties: \nit is a nontoxic plant that improves the body’s ability to resist multiple forms of \nstress—including physical, chemical, and biological sources—by increasing its \nability to adapt and survive.4\nNo matter how stressors are affecting the brain and body, adaptogens can help \nto bring us into balance. For example, if we are too anxious, they calm us down, \nand if we are depressed, they brighten up our mood. Like ashwagandha, lemon \nbalm, and ginseng, which are true adaptogens that have been used in Chinese, \nIndian, and Western medicine to treat stress, cannabis can hack your perspective \nso that you can thrive, even in the presence of illness. Lastly, the vast array of products available can help you continue to reap the \nbenefits of cannabis. When a cannabinoid receptor interacts with the exact same \ncannabinoid molecule over and over again, the receptor actually involutes, or dis-\nappears into the host cell. This is what happens whenever we develop a tolerance \nto any type of medication: the receptors need more in order to continue to work. However, when there is a subtle variation in the army of cannabinoid products, \ntheir molecules will be different. By consuming different cannabis forms at varying \ntimes and volumes, you will get longer-lasting effects without creating a tolerance. Ten Reasons to Get Past the Stigma and Feel Better\nThere’s a pervasive misconception in our culture that cannabis is a substance \nthat’s bad for you.

Don’t get hung up on a particular brand \nor name of a product: you really have to focus on the ingredient or series of ingredi-\nents.

While the entire cannabis plant produces cannabinoids, including the \nsticks, leaves, and roots, none are quite as potent and concentrated in cannabinoids \nas the flower portion, called a cola when it is dried. The most medicinal part of \nthe flower is called kief, the dried trichomes containing THC, CBD, terpenes, and \nflavonoids. Smoked flower using a joint, bowl, bong, chillum, and so on aerosolizes \nthe kief and uses the other leafy plant parts as a wick to continuously heat various \nsections of the flower. There are people who have smoked in the past and continue to love smoking \nbecause of the instantaneity of its effects. Smoking involves heating cannabis to \nvery high temperatures, which yields a fast reaction time and a larger release of \ncannabinoids: the hotter the compound that’s coming in, the more intense the \neffect is likely to be, as cannabinoids can vault into the bloodstream directly and \nefficiently. Yet exposing body tissues, such as the mouth and throat, to extreme \nheat accompanies increased blood flow to the exposed surfaces, which is why you \nmay feel discomfort in the back of your throat, or cough, when you smoke. What’s more, smoking is probably the most obviously harmful method of \nconsuming cannabinoids over the long term, which is why I don’t recommend \nit, particularly for the uninitiated. Smoking brings harmful compounds into the \nbody, including ash, carbon monoxide, and tar, the same toxins that are also \nfound in tobacco cigarettes. Tar is sticky and can affix to your teeth or lung tis-\nsue, as well as to your furniture, rugs, and clothing, often leaving lasting odors \nand sediment. However, I do understand that medicine is often a risk-benefit analysis. And there are some people for whom no other cannabis product seems to work \nquite as well as smoking. It may be as simple as embracing the familiarity: old \nhabits die hard, and exploring new methods can be daunting.",

In contrast, taking one-third of a gram and putting it into a vaporizer that \ncan be set with temperature precision, could yield three sessions, so that one gram \ncould last a full nine sessions. What’s more, when you smoke flower, you cannot \nreuse the ash. After you vaporize flower, on the other hand, the residue can be used \nto create a tincture, because many of the cannabinoids are still available even after \nit’s been vaped. Lastly, vaping temperatures are usually about one-tenth of the \ntemperatures reached by smoking, and they are still effective at releasing nearly the \nfull amount of cannabinoids. Vaping\nVaping is shorthand for consuming aerosolized cannabinoids via a vaporizer. Individual cannabinoids, when heated to precise boiling-point temperatures, \ncan be aerosolized into the lungs using a vaporizer. There are various types of \nvaporizers: some heat the cannabis with direct contact, while others act indi-\nrectly. A convection vaporization, for example, warms cannabis with a device \nthat includes a fan underneath the heating system. The fan blows hot air through \ncannabinoid concentrate or flower into a conduit, which can then be inhaled. Conduction vaporization puts direct contact between the product and a heat \nsource. Cannabis vapor pens (and their nicotine-based counterparts) operate \nusing this principle: they use a small hot plate to vaporize concentrate, which \nthen travels through a tiny mouthpiece. If this is your preferred method, invest \nin a high-quality vapor pen: the inexpensive options are often made cheaply \nand can emit toxic metal particles into your lungs. Dispensaries offer the purest \nregulated products that will not include additives that may be dangerous when \ninhaled. Although the degree to which dispensaries regulate the purity of their \nproducts varies, all regulated stores provide tested vaping products that are safe \nfrom such toxins.",

The problems you may have heard of per-\ntaining to vapor cartridges back in 2019 have been resolved. Those issues involved \nhomemade products and were never associated with cannabinoid cartridges that \nwere professionally produced. However, most of us grew up learning that anything \nwe inhale that isn’t air—particularly “smoke”—was akin to swallowing air pollu-\ntion. In fact, vaporized cannabis products are generally well tolerated and are not \nassociated with the toxins or the intense heat of smoking. It’s always a risk-benefit \nequation: you may be giving up instant results for a healthier solution. So just like \neverything else about this cannabis journey, you will have to pick the product that \nbest suits your needs. Cannabis Concentrates/Distillates\nBesides flower, you can also purchase different blends of cannabis concentrates. These come as a wax or other oily substances, all derived from kief. Concentrates \nand distillates are a highly purified form of cannabis and can be very potent. They \nare sold by weight at dispensaries, or you can make your own. There are many ways to heat the waxy forms: by direct or indirect heat sources, \nas part of combustion, or some combination. Or you can expose cannabis concen-\ntrate to a heat source, and inhale the vapor that results. For example, you could use a \ndevice called a dab rig: this is a metal nail that heats up to red-hot temperatures. You \nplace a small amount of concentrate on top (called a dab), then wait about a half min-\nute for the nail to cool to its original color, which signifies that the temperature of the \ndab is appropriate for building a puff of cannabis. On contact, the heat from the nail \ninstantly vaporizes the concentrate into a cloud of particles that can then be inhaled.

They are related to size and frequency: how many \ntimes you are ingesting a product, and at what dosage. The first strategy is referred to as macrodosing , which means taking a larger \namount to achieve a single, robust therapeutic effect.

In reality, you probably were \nexposed to too much THC at one time. It’s very common for people who take too \nmuch THC to feel out of sorts, so if you want to try THC products, erring on the \nside of underdosing will be more comfortable at first, yet possibly less effective and \nless pleasurable. Over time, you may become accustomed to THC naturally, and \nhigher doses will be both better tolerated and more effective. Luckily, you can now choose the degree to which your thought patterns are \naffected. Generally speaking, THC can offer a welcome washing away of recurring \nstress or sad thoughts, yet for some, this change in mindset can be off- pu\ntting, and \nclearheaded relaxation of the body is preferable. My clinical approach is almost \nalways cautious. I would rather someone experience no relief at all, at first, than \nanything that makes them uncomfortable, pessimistic, or derails them. That means \nI often recommend to start with low doses, using THC-containing products at a \nbare minimum, at least for first-time users, because there’s little risk of unsettling \nmind alteration. If you are just starting out and hoping to discover choices for \nlasting relief, look toward high-CBD, low-THC products. CBD products work more powerfully on the body and are used to relax mus -\ncle tissues and bring about an overall level of calm. THC products are less effective \non the body but are better for altering mental health issues because they affect the \nbrain in a more direct, influential way. For those who have had experience with \nTHC, a mixture of CBD and THC can feel dramatically less satisfying than pure \nTHC. The appeal of THC is that you will find relief for your symptoms, and at \nthe same time, will have an all-encompassing experience of joy. Lastly, THC is \noften associated with appetite stimulation and is used to treat a loss of appetite, \nwhile CBD is typically associated with the opposite effect, reducing appetite and/\nor reversing the appetite-stimulating effects of THC.",

In case of unpleasant \neffects from cannabis, CBD may reverse (or help prevent) an uncomfortable expe-\nrience. For some people exploring cannabis, time is of the essence, and trialing \nslowly may not be the desired path forward. Rather than starting with small doses \nof cannabinoids, you could try a product with both CBD and THC, so that less \nTHC will bind into receptors, and the CBD acts to protect from the uncomfort-\nable feelings associated with THC. Yet for some people, the two types of cannabi -\nnoid molecules appear to serve a synergistic relationship rather than a competitive \none, and their experience is not subdued by CBD, but rather augmented by it. There is literature that points to positive effects at a 20:1 ratio (20 CBD to \n1 T\nHC),1 and I have found that it is a good ratio for the uninitiated. Oftentimes \nthe effectiveness of the enhanced CBD is sufficient to achieve effective relief for \nmost physical ailments, and it easily avoids altering mental status for those who are \nparticularly worried about the effects of THC. Another benefit is that this type of \nproduct can be used at any time, at work or home. The downside is that the psycho-\nlogical relaxation effects of THC are absent, and for those who would benefit from \nmore psychological relief, CBD-dominant choices don’t seem to do quite as well.

In Massachusetts, where I live, medicinal \nproducts at the dispensary are less expensive than similar items found at the adult-\nuse shops, and you can find more low-dose choices at dispensaries.

The reason is that most states that \nhave both medical dispensaries and adult-use shops are mandated to keep a cer-\ntain portion of their sales for medical use: if they have a stockpile of products, \nthey’re required to offer those to medical patients first.

Most often, there is little to no emphasis on any objective \nlaboratory testing, imaging, or a physical exam. If the medical provider believes \nthe state’s qualifying conditions have been met by the patient, and if there are \nno clear prohibitive factors, the patient will receive their medical card. Depend-\ning on the individual location and the certifying provider, this evaluation and \napproval process can cost anywhere from less than a hundred dollars up to \nseveral hundred.

Until recently, many believed that because \ndecarboxylated forms of THC are more euphoric, its preheated form was inactive. This has been disproven, and not only are the pre-decarboxylated forms active \nin the body, but in some cases, these so-called “acid forms” may have their own \nadvantages over heated forms. Consuming unheated cannabis (mixing the raw \nplant form into smoothies, for example) has been studied for treatments including \ninflammation and nausea. Heating partially, at lower temperatures through decar-\nbing, can give you the advantages of both forms. The most common way to decarb cannabis is to first choose a flower product \nthat features a variety of colors, visible crystals, and hairs. Break the flower into \nsmall pieces, placing it on a sheet pan and baking it in an oven at 220 degrees for \ntwenty-five minutes. It is also recommended to drop the temperature lower, and \nbake a little bit longer, to preserve more terpenes (some of them evaporate at higher \ntemperatures), which in turn will give you a broader variety of medicinally active \ncompounds. Once you have decarbed the cannabis, you are ready to use it to make \nan edible, following the recipes in this chapter. While ingesting cannabis is discrete, the preparations aren’t as much. Decar -\nbing will create a strong aroma of cannabis in your kitchen. For those who are \nconcerned about the aroma, there are products that neutralize the odors from \ndecarboxylation, as well as from carrying or consuming cannabis. Upgrading Cannabis Flower\nAn easier way to hack cannabis plants to produce the desired effect you may be \nlooking for is to combine them with products that have known characteristics.

Right now, the commercial ecosystem cannot effectively extract all of these \ncompounds efficiently or affordably. Instead of waiting for industry to catch up \nwith your needs, you can extract these same compounds at home by boiling canna-\nbis flower at specific temperatures and then vaporizing the medicine of your choice. Different components of cannabis have different boiling point temperatures \n(see chart on the following page). Many vaporizers sold today can target specific \ntemperatures. By adjusting the temperature of your vaporizer, you can control \nwhich compounds (cannabinoids, terpenoids, and flavonoids) rise into the air (typ-\nically up into a mouthpiece or an inflatable bag to capture the gas), so you can \nselect the medicinal qualities you need. Then, you can experiment with dosage \nand frequency of the newly vaporized product in exactly the same way you would \nexperiment with any other cannabis product. Prior to heating the plant to the temperature that will aerosolize your desired \ncompound, consider heating to a slightly lower temperature for a few seconds, \nwithout inhaling, before moving up. This way, the molecules that vaporize at lower \ntemperatures can be exhausted first, and the result after raising the heat slightly \nwill be a higher density of those desirable components that had not yet boiled off  \nat lower temperatures. For example, my patient Eric, who suffers from migraines, \nsets his vaporizer at specific degrees using the same cannabis flower product and \ngets dramatically different outcomes. First, he heats his flower to 250º Fahrenheit, \nso that the acids on the raw flower, and CO2, are being gassed off. On the weekends, he heats cannabis flower to 250º and then to 315º, at \nwhich point he will be inhaling more Delta-9-THC than was available to him \nfrom his initial purchase. This compound helps him control his migraines while \nproviding an increased opportunity for sleep. It also comes with a more euphoric \neffect that doesn’t compromise his job. Each time Eric vaporizes, he is not extract-\ning the full contents of the cannabinoids, so the 315º boiling point product can \nlast two or three sessions. However, with each subsequent session, the result tastes \nmore like burnt popcorn.",

Use Water-Soluble Tinctures for Edibles\nA\nlcohol-based tinctures will easily mix with water and other liquids, while \noil-based tinctures won’t, and will therefore limit your ability to consume \nthe full dose. However, oil-based tinctures can be made water- so\nluble at home. These tinctures are available in the marketplace, but they can be difficult to \nfind. Simply blend the existing infusion vigorously with an emulsifier, such as \ngum arabic or Acacia senegal. Emulsifying the cannabis- ba\nsed oil with gum \narabic makes it easy to incorporate the product into any water-based cocktail \nrecipe. Emulsifying your tincture with gum arabic and adding a non-cannabis \nliquid will slightly dilute the known dose of the cannabis oil, introducing \nsome uncertainty about its strength, but also increasing the opportunity to \nmix desirable flavors and potentially more appealing foods or drinks.",

Cannabis, which inherently \npresents the brain with opportunities to discover novelty, for creating new con -\nnections, and strengthening old connections that have been lost, can be a very \neffective tool during meditation.

Cannabis Isn’t a Coping Mechanism\nS\nome people use cannabis as a crutch to help them avoid the difficulties \nof life, because it offers such an effective way to relax. So it would be no \nsurprise that, beyond your specific medical needs, you may find that cannabis \nbecomes part of your process for relaxing. While I’m certainly not opposed to \nthis, be aware that cannabis can improve your stress levels, but only for a short \nperiod of time. While you may find an otherwise elusive sense of calmness \nwhen consuming cannabis, if you have consistent, even chronic stressors, no \namount of cannabis product alone can overcome them. Cannabis use is not a free pass for avoiding your issues. If you forget to \npractice the often-difficult skills of engaging in life, you’re going to suffer even \nmore. That’s why I recommend that you practice living with stressors without \ncannabis—to see how you can alleviate those difficulties on your own. All \nof us need to develop effective coping skills to help us manage the ups and \ndowns of life. Asking a friend for help, taking time off, exercise, meditation, \ngetting better sleep, and upgrading your diet—all of the ways we discussed \nimproving your environment in this chapter—are proven strategies that will \nwork now and over time. Cannabis won’t have the long-term benefits that \nthese factors, as well as improving your interpersonal skills, will provide. If you are faced with a life that seems too complicated, or too burden -\nsome to navigate alone, ask for help.",

He was already taking a boatload of medicines because his doctor told him \nthat otherwise he would have a heart attack; he had a strong family history of \nheart disease.

Jimmy wanted to talk to me about cannabis therapies that could poten-\ntially help him lose weight in the hopes that he could get his health back \non track. He knew he didn’t want to smoke cannabis because he had kids \nat home. He wanted to know if there were other options available to him. I \nexplained that Jimmy’s regimen would be under his full control. We reviewed \nthe basics of the formulations and the products he could choose from to fi  nd \nsomething that would appeal to him. We picked a CBD-dominant tincture \nfor the days that he needs to be more motivated to exercise, and a dispensary \nfl  ower rich in THCV (known to suppress appetite and improve insulin pro-\nduction) for relaxation following high-stress days, or for when he was feeling \noverwhelmed or needed to sleep better. He could also take them together to \nhelp him improve his anxiety and his exercise tolerance. Th  ree months later we had a telehealth appointment, and I could tell that \nJimmy was noticeably well rested. He was excited to let me know that he was \nstarting to lose weight for the fi  rst time in years. He was able to exercise more \nfrequently each week, and was in a lot less pain.

However, freely flowing cannabis will act on whatever \ntissues it interacts with, and any medications that affect the brain’s chemistry will \nbe affected by cannabis. For instance, antidepressant medications typically exert \ntheir effects at the serotonin-signaling neuron junctions in the brain. Cannabis \nactivates these same junctions, albeit in a slightly different manner, and the result \nof the combination of antidepressant and cannabis medication is typically a syn-\nergistic boosting of the effects of both medications. This means that while you are \ntaking antidepressants, you may find that you need a smaller cannabis dosage to \nachieve the effect you are looking for. And the presence of cannabis means that you \nmay also be able to use less medication to achieve the same pharmaceutical goals. The part of the body that processes medicines, namely the liver, also breaks \ndown cannabis. When liver enzymes are preparing one medicine, they are not \navailable to degrade cannabis. The result is that the cannabis you consumed may \ntake another turn through the system circulation, and the effect tends to be more \npotent. Conversely, when the liver’s acting on cannabis, other medicines that are \ntypically degraded also tend to be more potent. Some medications, like blood \nthinners (Warfarin/coumadin, for example), are particularly affected when can-\nnabis is on board, so much so that the mixture can become toxic. Because of this \nmechanism, be cautious about introducing many different medicines or forms of \ncannabis into the body at the same time. If you’re taking multiple medications and \nadding cannabinoids, do so in small increments and with patience. Be attentive to \nany changes in how you feel that may be linked to the interaction between your \nmedication and cannabis, and not merely because of each component. The highest \nrates of success with cannabis use, in the long view, are when it is combined with \nmultiple different types of other treatments or therapies (both within cannabis as \na therapeutic and with respect to more traditional medical therapies).

The repercussion can look like anxiety, \ndepression, or a predilection to PTSD or pain. In contrast, individuals flush with \ncannabinoids tend to be happy, satisfied, and free of pain and depression. Cannabinoids allow the brain to change the path of well-worn thought chan -\nnels, hacking our emotional and cognitive rigidity so that new ideas and feelings \ncan emerge. One of the hallmarks of talk therapy is getting people to develop new, \nhealthier thought patterns so that we can interpret our experience of life through \na different lens, or employ different behavioral strategies to achieve healthier out-\ncomes. To do that, we need to be able to create a new mental space, opening us to \nthose opportunities and allowing new realities to grow. When we activate the endo-\ncannabinoid system, we allow different areas of the brain to cross-  co\nmmunicate, \nopening us to a flood of new thought processes. This process is known as neuro -\nplasticity, which describes the adaptability of the brain to make new connections. As nerves in the brain are flushed with exposure to cannabis, they are more mal -\nleable to change, which can affect anxiety, depression, and our experience of pain. This enhanced brain communication also allows us to feel either hyper-focused, \nwhich is why you may feel more creative when using cannabis, or hyper-relaxed.

Stud -\nies show that when people take traditional anti-inflammatories, like ibuprofen \n(Advil), there is a positive impact on emotional health and mental health.4 Canna-\nbis is known to act as a strong anti-inflammatory, acting on both the brain and the \nbody to relieve pain and improve mood. What’s more, cannabinoid and terpenoid compounds serve as powerful \nbuffers against the detrimental effects of persistent stress, which is mediated by \nour natural stress hormone system (the cortisol and adrenaline released during a \nfight/flight/freeze response). The presence of cannabinoid molecules disrupts each \npart of the response so that fewer stress hormones are released, and fewer bind \nto receptors, leading to a decrease in the long-term effects of these hormones. By \ndoing so, cannabis is indirectly influencing emotion, mood, energy levels (fatigue \nor vigor), and memory.5 For instance, we know that cannabis activates the heart \nand increases heart rate. When people using cannabis feel their heart racing, they \nare also experiencing a release of endorphins and stress hormones. As a result, \nthey may interpret their heart racing as “scary.” This experience commonly sets off \nfeelings of paranoia—the presence of fear without attribution—that is associated \nwith cannabis: the user is sensing a physical change in the body that makes them \nfeel stressed or anxious.

To my mind, and in the results I see with many of my patients, these \ntwo functions allow cannabis to replace the internal wiring/signaling of pain with \none of joy. As a medication, cannabis restores the brain’s chemical equilibrium in ways \nsimilar to how antidepressants are designed to work. Antidepressants mimic brain \nchemicals or influence them. First, cannabis acts on the same systems of brain \nchemistry, making antidepressants more efficient. And like many depression, anx-\niety, and pain medications, cannabinoids stimulate neural growth so that the brain \nhas stronger connectivity, enabling its natural chemical messengers to work more \nefficiently.

In fact, it \ncan improve all of these conditions, which you’ll see throughout the book. Some medications used to treat anxiety, like benzodiazepines—Xanax, \nValium, Ativan—are not only dangerous and addictive; they’re very short-acting. As satisfying as these quick-acting options are, the medications are rapidly habit \nforming and easily hit a level of tolerance, incurring a need for steadily increasing \ndose requirements. Despite the popular and misinformed rumor, cannabis is not \nany more addictive than caff  eine.

You Don’t Have to Go Through Life Stressed\nW\ne all have stressors in our lives, and sometimes they bubble up beyond \nour control. No matter the source of stress, it is healthy and important \nto find ways to resolve the source of problems and restore an even-  te\nmpered \nequilibrium. For some, a walk does the trick. For others, it’s meditation or \nyoga. For a growing number of people, cannabis has become an effective tool \nfor stress relief. Stress can range from subtle mood changes, lasting aggravation, and at \nthe other end of the spectrum, symptoms of dissociation where you lose touch \nwith what you are doing or even where you are. I remember one patient who \ncalled me in the middle of a panic attack, not knowing where she was and \nfeeling completely out of control.",

Treating Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD/ADHD) \nAnother component of mental health is the ability to place the right amount of atten-\ntion to a specific task, as well as the interpretation and memory of that attention. ADD/ADHD presents differently for different people, and although it’s often spoken \nabout in the context of children, many adults suffer from it. Some are fidgety and \nhave difficulty attending to anything. Others have hyper-focus and cannot let go of a \ncertain task. Still others can focus appropriately, but can’t remember what they were \nattending to because they are plagued with competing thoughts and distractions. Cannabis temporarily curtails some streams of short-term memory so that \nusers can stay in the moment, unburdened by emotional or sensory intrusions, and \ncomplete the task at hand. In many ways it quiets an overactive brain. Compared \nto traditional ADD/ADHD medications like Adderall, Ritalin, guanfacine, and \nothers, cannabis is equally stimulating without leading to a loss of appetite, insom-\nnia, and persistent heart racing. It can bring relaxation to both a hyper-  fo\ncused \nand strongly divided mind, and can ease the stressful burden of ruminative self-  \nas\nsessment that often comes with ADD. Because symptoms of ADD are not so far off from typical stressors, many \npeople with this disorder have been “self-medicating” with cannabis without ever \ngetting a formal diagnosis. So it’s no surprise that this strategy works. However, \nwe live in a culture that has stigmatized self-medicating to the point that it is \na pejorative term. It suggests that someone is relying excessively on, or abusing, \ndrugs or alcohol to make it through the day. In my experience, it is clear that \ncannabis does help address these conditions, and even without a formal diagnosis \nor an authoritative awareness of their condition, this strategy is actually a form of \nvaluable self-care.",

For instance, \nit is very common for older, retired adults who have the freedom to stay up late at \nnight reading or watching television to lose track of time, ending up with too few \nhours of sleep. The subtle, short-term disruptions do add up to meaningful health \nimpacts. Over time, this disruption not only affects the quality of our sleep; it \ncan affect many other aspects of our overall health, including weight gain, heart \ndisease, and even diabetes.3 \nWe also know that our circadian rhythm is intimately connected with our \nendocannabinoid system. Sleep is, in part, governed by a tiny gland in the brain \nthat is thought of as the master clock. This gland is known to be impacted by the \ncannabinoids already in our endocannabinoid system as well as external cannabis \nproducts.4 When our circadian rhythm is disrupted, cannabinoids can act as a \nreset to our circadian clock, and they do so by activating the brain’s microglial \ncells. Some cannabinoids can also hack your rhythm to get you back on track \nby promoting relaxation, comfort, and reducing distracting signals. For instance, \nshift workers who work at night and have to sleep during the day use cannabis \nproducts to help them align their schedule with their desired sleep regimen. Cannabis and the Stages of Sleep\nHaving a great night’s sleep means that you have slept soundly through multiple \ncycles of quiet sleep and active sleep. Quiet sleep takes place in three stages: drows-\niness, light sleep, and deep sleep. Light sleep is really the first phase of true sleep. Deep sleep occurs when the brain becomes less responsive to external stimuli, \nmaking it difficult to wake up. These three stages of quiet sleep alternate with peri-\nods of active sleep, which is referred to as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.",

Cannabis can treat migraines because it \ncan act as an anti-convulsant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and an anti-emetic \n(prevents vomiting). Cannabis is an ideal treatment for migraines because of its powerful anti-  \nin\nflammatory nature. This is also the reason why lotions applied directly to the \nhead or neck where you are experiencing pain are so effective: systemic treatments \nfor inflammation are good, but a strong, local topical can work faster and stron-\nger. In fact, one of the most common applications of topical cannabis is treating \nmigraines. The key is to attack the intracranial tissues.

Why Cannabis Works on Headaches\nLike some traditional headache medicines, cannabis can be used to help prevent \nheadaches, limit how long they last, and shift the response to managing them \nwhen they do arise. Any type of headache can be viewed as having three fun-\ndamental components: a cause or source of trouble; a communication channel \nthrough which the pain signals may travel; and the destination, where the nerve \nsignals of discomfort are received and interpreted. Cannabis can treat headaches \nand their associated symptoms at each of these three phases. At the origination point, or source of pain, cannabis is effective at relaxing \nmuscle tissues, reducing nerve irritation, and lowering inflammation. For instance,",

For pain associated with \nuneven tension of upper body muscles, cannabis soothes muscles to a less tense \nequilibrium at the muscle of origin. Cannabis can disrupt the communication of pain signals by connecting with \nspecific receptors found in almost every cell in the body, including nerve cells. In \nthe case of primary headaches, and particularly for migraines, muscular tension, \nand stress-associated headaches, consumed cannabis molecules interact with these \nsame receptors and exert therapeutic effects by dialing back the signaling of the \nnerves that sense or transmit pain signals. This can occur because cannabis has \nthe ability to influence electrical ion shifts at the cellular level to create or dampen \nelectrical signals. These electrical signals transmit or reduce the flow of electrical \nions (potassium, calcium, and sodium) inside and out of the cell rapidly, influenc-\ning pain signals almost immediately. For instance, when you have a headache, the \nnerve signaling that alerts you to the fact that you have pain occurs in predictable \nways. Charged molecules are released and kick-start a chain reaction that sends the \nheadache signal along a set of nerves to the topmost part of the spinal cord. There, \na second electrical signal is sent to a different region of the brain, which identifies \nthe headache sensation. Along the way, other regions of the brain receive copycat \nsignals and interpret discomfort, attach related memories, and trigger emotions \nlike frustration, anger, anxiety, and fixation. At each point in the nerve’s electrical \ntransmission, cannabis can dampen the strength of the signal. The result is that you \nexperience a softened perception of the intensity of pain, both locally and system-\nically. Locally, it subdues the signals of discomfort and reduces regional inflam -\nmation in the head. Systemically, the presence of cannabis molecules reduces the \nbody’s overall stress response; amplifies signals of comfort and satisfaction; and \nthrough the diminishing of neural signaling, creates what is often described as \na “vacation” or “break” from discomfort. And when headaches happen to come \nwith other unpleasant symptoms, such as nausea, muscular tension, and anger or \nfrustration, cannabis can address those symptoms, too, impacting the electrical \nnerve signaling in a similar fashion. The final stop on the headache pathway is the brain.",

For headaches, it is almost like having multiple types of medications \nworking simultaneously. Cannabis acts as a pain reliever, mood stabilizer, \nanti- in\nflammatory, and anti-anxiety medication. This can mean that your \nheadaches resolve faster, while you are treating other symptoms. Traditional NSAID headache medicines act on prostaglandins, which \nare molecules that control processes including inflammation, blood flow, and \nnerve transmission. Cannabinoids also act on prostaglandins, while having \nother powerful effects on even stronger inflammatory agents called cytokines. Antidepressants that are used to treat headaches act by increasing serotonin, \nparticularly at 5-HT1 receptors. Cannabinoids act on the same 5-HT1 recep-\ntors and also increase serotonin in other ways. 2 \nOn the largest scale, cannabis is engaging with the full spectrum of the \nbrain’s natural neurotransmitter receptors, including dopamine, noradrena -\nline, glutamate, acetylcholine, GABA, and the opiates. In effect, it has the \npotential to recalibrate the brain toward optimal health. Treating Headaches with Cannabis\nOnce you have identified which type of headache you suffer from, treating it with \ncannabis is easy. For some headaches, the opportunity to quash the pain early, \nbefore it travels to new areas of the head, or before the pain grows, or before it \nbecomes intractable, can make the difference between function and failure.",

However, malnourished, frayed nerves are prone to misfiring, causing \ncognitive and physical challenges. Cannabis is thought to assist the flow of nutrition to the brain by improv -\ning arterial blood flow by lowering inflammation and relaxing the smooth muscle \ntissue that lines all arteries. This is done by enhancing the release of a naturally \noccurring chemical, nitric oxide, along arterial walls.1 It can also enhance brain \ngrowth factors. Low doses of cannabis molecules initially suppress brain-derived \nneurotropic factors (BDNF), which are needed to provide nutrition to brain \ncells.2 When BDNF is suppressed, the brain has a built-in feedback mechanism \nto increase production. However, when there is an excessive amount of cannabis \navailable, it can handicap brain growth, as this feedback mechanism cannot keep \nup with the demand. Cannabis is thought to support the well-being of both the neural sheath and \nthe nerves themselves. For every sequence of nerves, the stimulation of cannabi -\nnoid receptors where two nerves come together activates the originating nerve. 3 \nThis activation enhances normal cell functions and encourages the nerve to thrive. When your brain is full of healthy nerve connections, it is able to correctly process \nsensory input, higher cognitive function, and often, deeper analytical skills. It can \nalso foster a healthier response to the buildup of plaque or tangles of proteins in the \nbrain that may be impeding the brain’s ability to function optimally. Ultimately \nthrough these mechanisms, cannabis can help orchestrate the reversal of some \nstructural damage and provide an environment that is better able to nourish the \ncells so that they continue working.

For instance, \nin 2004, there was a study of 136 patients that showed dramatic, positive results \nusing cannabinoid products alone, without other anti-epileptic drugs.7 Other pub-\nlished case reports have confirmed reduced seizure intensity as well as fewer pro -\nvoked seizures when cannabis is added to traditional seizure medications.

While the connection between cannabis use and lower seizure rates seems to \nbe favorable, it is not absolutely so. In some cases, connections have been made \nbetween cannabis use and increased seizure activity. One explanation for these \npotentially confusing findings is that those who use cannabis to help manage their \nseizures may have an occasional breakthrough seizure resulting from a trigger or \nother illness. Or it may be that as the systemic cannabinoid levels fall between \ndoses, in someone with epilepsy, the lower level of cannabinoids is insufficient. Outside of cannabis, the most successful seizure medications for both pre -\nvention and treatment are classified as anti-epileptics, including levetiracetam \n(Keppra), carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Tegretol), phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek), \noxcarbazepine (Trileptal), lamotrigine (Lamictal), phenobarbital, and lorazepam \n(Ativan).

In essence, pain isn’t \nrequired to prevent further injury. One of the functions of the endocannabinoid system is to tamp down the \ninflammatory response. Cannabis has a direct effect on inflammation of all types, \nfrom acute to chronic, localized to systemic.5 For example, pain caused by tissue \nor nerve damage responds well to cannabis’s strong anti-inflammatory action. Even as it works to lower inflammation in one region, there is a positive down-\nstream benefit that incrementally reduces systemic inflammation: the cannabis \nlotion you apply to an arthritic knee is going to combat the inflammation at your \nknee, and as it gradually enters your bloodstream, you may also notice that you \nfeel fewer symptoms of stress. The converse is also true: for those who use canna-\nbinoid therapies as a system-wide anti-inflammatory to treat autoimmune condi -\ntions, they also find that their acutely inflamed tissues, such as acne, may improve. What’s more, excessive swelling, which might sometimes shield damaged tissues \nfrom further insult, can also unnecessarily delay healing. In the presence of a \nstrong anti- in\nflammatory medicine like cannabis, extraneous immune elements \ndissipate while more essential repair elements remain, and a more appropriate \nresponse can begin.

However, her story helps us understand the role of \nthe endocannabinoid system when it comes to pain management. From there, \nwe can infer the real role cannabis products can have in addressing pain for \nthe rest of us. Provides a Mental Distraction from Pain \nIn addition to its action on direct physical sensations of pain, cannabis provides \neasy access to a powerful set of psychological tools that can enable you to change \nyour desired focus and attention, and in some circumstances, allow you to dis-\ntract completely from your pain. As cannabis flows through the bloodstream, your \nability to attend to multiple stimuli and sensations at the same time is broadened. This experience gives you the opportunity, and choice, to focus your attention on \nwhatever may be more appealing than the experience of your pain. Overall, this \nwill make your pain seem less intense. Unlike narcotic medications like opioids, which unreservedly counteract the \nvery sensations of pain and replace them with an overall sense of gratification, \ncannabinoids act on the same opiate receptors, yet less powerfully. Rather than \nthoroughly numbing pain, the experience of discomfort is downgraded and gen-\nerally felt to be less intense or less all consuming.",

Most pain management medications \nare typically formulated to address only some of these mechanisms: For instance, \nibuprofen quiets the initial transmission of the pain signal from its source. Opiates \nattack the reception and interpretation of pain signals in the brain, and they can \naffect the memory of pain. Antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications like gab-\napentin, amitriptyline, or doxepin also address components of the brain’s signal -\ning circuitry, the memory of pain, and the component of identity that frequently \naccompanies longer-term discomfort, yet they do not appear to have a meaningful \nimpact on the production or transmission of pain signals. Only cannabis attacks all of these mechanisms at once. Cannabinoids will quiet \nthe localized transmission of pain signals where it hurts, mitigate the brain’s attention \nto these weaker signals, temporarily obscure the memory of pain, and allow the suf-\nferer to positively adjust their relationship with pain so that it no longer defines them. The Transmission of Pain Signaling from a Source\nPain typically begins with an electrical signal sent from nerve endings anywhere \non the body that are sensitive to pressure, temperature, and pain. This signal is \nthen carried by and through a series of sequential nerve channels to the spinal \ncord, which ultimately transmits the signal to the brain for processing.",

The Brain’s Interpretation of Pain\nPain can occur anywhere in the body, but you do not fully experience the pain \nuntil the message gets to your brain. Cannabinoids may play a vital role in the \nbrain’s interpretation of these signals. When cannabinoids flow abundantly in the \nbloodstream, the brain receives a filtered message about the pain, even if the thou-\nsands of nerves in your hand are all sending the same pain signals. This occurs \nbecause the cannabinoids are affecting the nerve signals from the source, as well \nas in the brain. Increased cannabinoid signaling at nerve endings recalibrates the \nstrength of the pain message to the brain. When there is a filtered signal, you will be able to focus more on other stimuli \nrather than your pain. This is a powerful tool that can be modified by your personal \npreferences. Products that are high in THC seem to have a greater influence on the \nnerve signaling in the brain; products that are high in CBD seem to be more effec-\ntive at quieting the nerve signaling coming from the body. What’s more, the way \nyour brain perceives and processes pain is also affected by the concept of set and \nsetting. If your environment is soothing, you are more inclined to pay attention to \nit rather than your pain, because it is more pleasing. On the other hand, if your set \nand setting is consistently neutral or uncomfortable, you are more likely to focus \non the pain signals, and cannabis won’t bring about the results you are looking for.",

While the precise mechanisms of the effects of cannabis on the gastroin -\ntestinal system are still a source of intense ongoing investigation, we do know \nthat the gastrointestinal tract is rich in cannabinoid receptors.1 What’s more, \ncannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids act in the body synergistically. Not only \ndo these compounds affect the action of one another,2 they also help to balance \nthe complex overlapping tides of chemical and nerve signaling within the gas -\ntrointestinal system. The result is a new equilibrium that facilitates healing and \neases discomfort. My experience with patients has taught me that the common \nperception that THC or CBD alone is the magic answer is inaccurate when it \ncomes to the gut. You have already learned that there are direct effects of cannabinoids on nerves \nand inflammation, and on blood flow. And cannabis is used to soothe emotional \ndistress. Each of these effects offers its own form of relief for gastrointestinal ail-\nments, alone or in combination, depending on the underlying cause. For example, \nif your stomach distress is related to autoimmune issues, like colitis, the ability \nof cannabinoids to stimulate tissue healing and strong anti-inflammation is what \nhelps to quash a flare-up of disease. The antimicrobial features of cannabis prod-\nucts appear to rebalance the gut flora toward a healthier equilibrium, aiding in the \nresolution of chronic bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and nauseousness. At the \nsame time, cannabis can address the anxiety that comes with or, in many cases, \nmay be causing the problem. There is debate in the scientific community about the origins of common \ngastrointestinal illnesses. Some believe that they are attributable to modern habits \nor exposures, while others point to archeological evidence of autoimmunity that \npredates modern humans as a species altogether.3 Whether or not foods and eating \nhabits are the cause of GI illness, or the ultimate origin is more deeply rooted in \ngenetics and evolution, effective treatments for bowel diseases seem to work best \nwhen they imitate nature, including natural foods and processes.

Or perhaps the visual cues are different from the orientation \nof the body in space, such as the nauseousness associated with motion sickness. Cannabis can soothe this type of upset stomach by dialing down the volume of \nnerve transmission.

When someone is trying \nto follow a strict diet, whether it’s to lose weight, gain weight, or to maintain a \nhealthier digestive system, they’re often picking foods toward their specific aims, \nwhich may not be as pleasurable as the chocolate cake they are giving up. Our \nbrains are hardwired to seek pleasurable experiences, which is one reason why it’s \nvery easy to be thrown off course when you are confronted with foods that taste \nnice. For example, someone who has celiac disease has to avoid gluten, and some-\ntimes the choices are limited and boring. Yet when there is cannabis present, you \ncan focus on your higher priority and enjoy the foods that may be less than tasty \nbecause it allows for a greater sensory experience. You can focus on the chewiness, \non the crunchiness, or on the saltiness. So when my patients ask me for a tip to \nhelp them succeed with their diet, I often tell them to take a cannabis product \nbefore making an eating decision. Just a small dose will give you an extra level of \ncommand over your own body and your own desires. One caveat to remember is that THC products will likely make you feel hungry. This occurs because cannabis stimulates hunger centers in the brain and gut, and it \ndries out the body, including the mouth and throat. These are both powerful natu-\nral signals to eat and drink. This effect can be countered with CBD products. And \nby anticipating these effects, you can make healthy choices when you are hungry.

The presence of increased \nacid alone causes physical damage to the whole GI tract, including the stomach, \nesophagus, intestines, and so on. This is the mechanism that connects mental distress with the physical man -\nifestation of GI issues.

These two elements create a vicious cycle that damages \nthe body even further. One can try to fix the systemic stress through therapy, med-\nitation, and medications. One can also try to fix their stomach issues with changes \nin diet, medications, or even surgery. Cannabinoids represent a third option that \nmay be new for many people because they can reset both the brain and the gut. We do know that cannabis products, especially those that are THC dominant, \nwill make your daily experience calmer and less stressed. Those same products may \nhelp calm your stomach pains and digestive ailments that are caused by stress. The \nreason is that the stomach houses the same brain chemical receptors that the endo-\ncannabinoid system binds with; in essence you are treating the brain and the gut \nat the same time. Second, when someone is calm, the nerves that activate digestion \nand amplify calm in the body—the parasympathetic nervous  sy\nstem—promote the \nforward movement of digestion. And when there is increased digestive flow, the tis-\nsues in the gut are less obstructed and experience less pressure on any one area, facil-\nitating better flow of nutrients, as well as creating space for healing damaged tissues.

Cannabis has a protective role in all \ninflammatory skin conditions, ranging from allergic reactions like contact derma-\ntitis, hives, and eczema to autoimmune conditions such as vitiligo and psoriasis. 3\nCannabis can be used to treat autoimmune skin disorders by balancing the \ncommunication channels that keep inflammation in check. For example, psoriasis \nand eczema are two distinct inflammatory autoimmune disorders in which the \nimmune system is fighting its own skin tissues. However, while either may show \nup in one area of the body or another, it’s really a whole-body problem. That’s why \na treatment like cannabis, which affects the whole body when taken systemically, \nis going to be more effective, because you’re addressing inflammation system-wide. You can certainly use topical cannabis as well, to address the local manifestation \nand local discomfort, and promote healing more quickly, while you are using it \nsystemically to address the root cause of the malady. If there is excessive activity in the skin, as with an overactive immune system, \nyou might imagine that turning off immunity in the region would be curative. However, if your immunity were cut off entirely, bacteria, fungal, or viral invaders \nmight escape this critical instrument of the body’s defense, and would thrive and \ncause equal, if not greater, damage or illness. Cannabis offers the same balanced \napproach to inflammation that it does to receptor activation: at times activating \nimmunity and at times calming it. Over the course of time, and under such con-\nditions of balance, skin tissues slowly come to a new, healthy equilibrium, whereby \nthe material that does not belong is gradually removed, and healthy tissues remain \nsustained and strong.",

Even when they are THC prominent, the formulations \nalmost never have euphoric effects. In fact, their broader effects typically \nspread to no more than twelve inches from where they are applied. The \ncommercial market seems to produce mainly weakly infused products; \nread labels to make sure you are getting a ratio of at least 100 mg of can-\nnabis to every ounce of finished product. If you can’t find what you need, \nyou can always make your own (see chapter four). For example, coconut \noil can be used as a base for hair products: many of my patients are apply-\ning it to the scalp to treat dandruff and stimulate the cells in the scalp to \nachieve hair growth. The mainstay of therapy for alopecia, the medical \ncondition of hair loss, is injection of steroidal anti-inflammatories. If you \nhave an anti-inflammatory like cannabis, which is stronger than steroids, \nit is reasonable to experiment and put it there and see what happens. In \nfact, a recent study has demonstrated that CB1 receptor antagonists do, \nindeed, induce hair growth in mice.9\n + Product recommendation #2—Cannabis cooking oil/body oil applied \ndirectly: This option offers a more concentrated dosage of cannabinoids \ncompared to a diluted balm. Oils provide more relief that lasts longer. However, oils can be messy and expensive, and do not fully penetrate the \nskin, leaving the skin feeling sticky. + Product recommendation #3—Skin patches:  Patches offer a discrete, \nlong-lasting diffusion of cannabinoids through the skin. They are not \neuphoric and require less frequent reapplication; one patch can last as long as \ntwelve hours. Place the patch near the affected area: if you are dealing with \nacne, for example, place the patch on the back of your neck or on your chest.

Strong research confirms that the endocannabinoid system \naffects both men and women at every stage of fertility: the generation and growth \nof a female’s reproductive follicles, a male’s sperm, the process of fertilization, the \ntransportation of ovum, and the processes of implantation and embryo develop-\nment. The fact of the endocannabinoid system’s involvement is not a subject of \ndebate, but how the elements of reproduction are impacted—whether for better or \nworse, what opportunities there may be to assist with fertility challenges, and what \nopportunities there may be to identify new means of birth control—is an area \nof exciting ongoing research. One aspect of investigation is the quality of semen \nwhen cannabis is involved. Some studies show that sperm swim slower and less \neffectively, and their numbers are reduced.12 The same is true for the fimbriae that \nline the fallopian tube; these are the microscopic, fingerlike projections of tissue \nthat line the fallopian tube, which help to move an egg closer to the uterus. When \ncertain forms of cannabis are on board, the fimbriae appear to be less efficient, and \nthere is a greater risk of failed or ectopic pregnancy.13\nWhile these studies seem to show that cannabis inhibits fertility, I see them \nin a slightly different light. In the setting of a culture that has, for generations, \ndemonized the use of cannabis, science has identified and repeatedly publicized \nan association between reduced fertility and cannabis use. Rather than interpret-\ning the relationship as an association, and with appropriate uncertainty—perhaps \ncouples were consuming cannabis to cope with their reproductive challenges, or \nexperimenting with cannabis as a treatment for fertility—a bias promoting the \nperceived harms of cannabis has systematically linked cannabis and infertility. Instead, I would argue that the overall effect changes the outcome only in \na very low percentage. It’s possible that people who are consuming cannabis are \nmore libidinous, and they’re having more sex, and typically report more enjoy-\nable experiences. This increased rate of sexual interaction may counterbalance the \ndecreased function.",

For instance, it can be hard to assess the major priorities of life immediately \nafter hearing a diagnosis, and you may want to think about “big picture” issues: \nWhat does my family want for the long term? What are the realistic cost limitations \nthat we have?",

Cannabis can change the signaling, activating cell death by opening chan -\nnels of communication where the cells can once again remember that they are \nsupposed to self-destruct. By doing so, cancer growth is stopped.1 In laboratory \nstudy, it appears that when cannabinoids are present, only the cancer cells activate \nself-elimination signaling, and surrounding healthy cells are totally unaffected.2 \nThat is a very different outcome compared to common chemotherapies, which \ntend to strike against all fast-growing cells, regardless of those cells’ origin or dam-\nage. This is why many people shed their hair and eyebrows during chemotherapy: \nhair is comprised of fast-growing cells, which can be inadvertently attacked and \nkilled off. Cannabis also inhibits the number of new cancer cells by many different \nknown mechanisms. When cancer cells are blossoming, or growing the same \nway our normal cells do, they are directed by communication signals to continue \ngrowing, to separate, divide, and produce new cells, in a process called prolif-\neration. Cannabis offers the opportunity for interruption of typical cancer cell \nproliferation signals, at a genetic level.3 The cannabis is not killing the cancer cell; \nit’s impacting the process of normal cell life. Cannabis can also interrupt other \nstages of the proliferation process. At many stages of the life of a cancerous cell, it \nbecomes less viable when cannabis is on board.4 \nCancer is bad where it first develops, but it can be worse when it moves into \nother places within the body.

With so much cannabis on board, you may not be \nable to function at the level that you’re used to. You may experience a change in \ncognition that can noticeably impact your career and home life. Cannabis allows \nfor cross-communication between different systems of the brain, which can lead \nto distraction for someone who is susceptible to distraction. It can also be hyper- \nfo\ncusing, leading to an inability to get “off task” or stop ruminating thoughts. However, once you develop a tolerance, these unpleasant feelings will go away, and \nyou will eventually find that further increases in dosing are less likely to come with \ndiscomfort. Sarah, one of my breast cancer survivors, once told me, “I’m taking \nhigh doses on a daily basis, and I don’t feel high anymore. My cancer seems to \nhave stopped growing, and I can manage my daily life again. I’m feeling hopeful \nbecause this has been a different journey than I first expected.”\nThe ultimate goal of cannabis cancer treatment is to achieve tolerance as the \ncancer goes away. If the cancer continues to grow and/or spread, you will have to \ncontinue to up the ante: try different cannabis strains or products, and try more of \nthem. The approach to treatment is to consume a huge amount of a broad-spectrum \nflower—featuring both THC and CBD as well as many other cannabinoids—as \nquickly as you can tolerate. If one strain or product doesn’t work, bring in another \nwithout discarding the first. The more variety you can handle at the same time, \nthe better. Typically, my patients find that if they begin with a tolerable small dose \nand increase dosage incrementally and steadily, it is possible to achieve very high \ndoses in a few weeks’ time. It’s very difficult to ingest large volumes consistently merely by inhaling, and \nbecause combustion is destructive to the plant, smoking or vaping are recommen -\ndations of last resort. Most people end up consuming cannabinoid-rich oils in the \nform of cannabis-dense edibles or tinctures because they offer the highest concen-\ntration of cannabinoids in the smallest package. Commercially prepared edibles \nare often decarboxylated so that they are more stable to sell. For treating most \nillnesses, that’s fine, but for cancer, the action of the pre-decarboxylated forms may \nbe equal, if not more effective, to combat cancer.
